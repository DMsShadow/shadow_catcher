## Chapter 3: Characters
In order to play a Dreamcatcher game, you will need to create a character. This will represent the person you will play in the game. The information about your character will be recorded on a character sheet. In some instances the GM may have characters prepared for you in advance, but usually you will create your own.

Dreamcatcher aims to make character creation as quick as possible, but it still involves a few steps where you will need to make important decisions about your character.

The decisions are laid out below in seven steps that you can follow to create your character.

### Step1: Character Premise

It is always best to start with you initial concept before you make any more decisions about the character you want to play. Do you want to play an honourable knight from a noble house, a skulking thief who is only out for themselves, or a wizard of an ancient arcane order? 

Whatever your concept, try to summarise it as a single sentence, and write this in the Character Premise line in the Facets section of the character sheet. Don’t worry about the exact wording, this can always be tweaked as the character develops, but the premise of your character should inform you in the next steps in creating your character.

### Step 2: Assign Ability Scores

At this stage it is now time to think about the mechanics of your character. The outcome of many actions in the game revolves around the numerical values in your character’s abilities. Determining your character’s scores in Dreamcatcher is simply a case of assigning a set of standard scores into each of your character’s abilities: 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1.

You should remember that as 2 is the human average for an ability, that all those above 2 show an above average talent for the approach, and that only one score (the 1), is below average.

It may help when assigning scores to think of it as prioritisation, and consider which ability you feel is most important for your character, assigning that the value of 5, and them working down from there.

>“…2 is the human average for an ability…”

When thinking about where to assign each score, it is also worth thinking back to your character premise. Would a knight have a high deft ability, or would they prioritise forcefulness over agility? Would they need to be more resilient than perceptive?

You will need to answer these questions yourself, as the character belongs to you, and it is therefore up to you as to how you play them. If you are the kind of player than wants to maximise your character’s abilities, then it may also be worth looking at the character paths and equipment sections later in the book, to ensure your character has access to the actions and weapons you want.

### Step 3: Create three Advantages

Now you have chosen your five ability scores, you can focus on the three things that make your character special. These should be the things that make you stand out from the crowd, and ideally be in line with your character’s premise.

All advantages should start with the description “Good with/at…” Continuing the example of the Knight above, the player may choose the following advantages:

* Good with a sword
* Good at riding a warhorse
* Good at Jousting

These are appropriate and in line with the character concept.

There are no rigid guidelines on writing advantages, but they should be specific but not too restrictive as to make them hard to ever call during a test.

For example, the Knights sword advantage above is appropriate, but the advantage “Good at fighting” may be too broad (Fighting how, or with what?). Conversely, “Good at fighting with my personal family longsword” is probably too narrow, as you wouldn’t be able to use it with any other sword.

This does not mean you cannot have broader or narrower advantages, but they will affect how useful or powerful characters are in the game. 

When considering advantages, it’s worth discussing with the GM as to how specific or board he wishes to be with these before you pick them. This will save on any disappointment.

### Step 4: Create a Relationship
A relationship is essentially an advantage that allows you to make use of a social relationship with another character in the game. These advantages can only be used in situations where the named character would be able to come to your aid, and in some way could help you out in the test or contest.

The relationship should be recorded as, “Has a good relationship with…”, for example:

* Has a good relationship with the Duke of Lancaster

In the case of the above, in any situation where the player can justify either the Duke’s reputation or direct aid to be of assistance, he can call the advantage to help him in the test.

As well as individuals, players can also suggest a group to have relationships with. These may potentially a wider field of expertise than an individual, but they tend to have less social and political impact depending on their nature.

The use of other player characters as your relationships is discouraged as they should instead work with you during the game. Also, powerful relationships (e.g. the King etc.) should not be given or taken lightly.

The GM is the final arbiter on which relationships are appropriate to take during the game.

### Step 5: Create a special Possession

Gear and equipment is handled very abstractly in Dreamcatcher. You are assumed to have access to any equipment that fits with your character premise, at the GMs discretion, but these items will not provide you with any mechanical bonus, they are simply aids to roleplaying.

Exceptions to this are special possessions that are named on your character sheet. These are items with which have a powerful impact, reputation, you have extra special affinity with, or anything else that makes them stand out from the norm.

Unlike advantages above, possessions by their nature should have very specific descriptions. Carrying on our previous example, a normal longsword would give the Knight no advantage, but an “Ancestral longsword balanced perfectly for my hand” would.

Unlike the other advantages, possessions like this can only be given out by the GM either as gifts from other characters, or as rewards for mission, quests etc. Again, these possessions are at the GMs discretion.

### Step 6: Create four Hindrances

As an opposition to your advantages you should now create four hindrances for your character (one for each advantage, excluding your special possession). The important thing to consider here is that these are not your character’s flaws so much as things they are not good at, but which they want to be better at.

Therefore, consider things that your character wants to be better at, but can’t do very well at the moment. The reason why this is important will be made clear when we look at character development later.

At the GMs discretion, one of your starting hindrances can be a poor relationship (see above), but it may be more appropriate to allow these to emerge through roleplaying and character development.

All hindrances should start with the description “Not good with/at…” Using the example of the Knight above, the player may choose the following hindrances:

* Not good at swimming
* Not good at heraldry
* Not good at talking to serfs
* Not good with a crossbow

These are appropriate and in line with the character concept.

The GM can call these hindrances whenever he feels they are appropriate and players are free to suggest calling them at any time too. Calling a hindrance is a good thing, as it can earn you a destiny point and will allow you to improve your character later.

### Step 7: Personal Touches

Now you have assigned your characters abilities, relationships, hindrances, and equipment you are almost finished. The character sheet has spaces to record the details that will make the character unique for you and enhance your roleplaying experience, if you have not already done so, now is a good time to look more at these.

#### Character Description

This section at the top of the front page of the character sheet is where you record all the details of what your character looks like, and a section to describe how they appear to others, including any personality traits you wish them to have.

**Pick a name.** You should come up with a suitable name for your character. There are no hard a fast rules for this, but consider something you feel fits with your concept.

**Description.** A final section is left for free text description. Here you can describe any distinctive characteristics such as tattoos, scars and the like. You can also describe clothing, general appearance and personality traits in this section.

### Step 8: Play your introduction

Now you have completed these steps you are ready to play your introduction adventure. This adventure is designed to give you a chance to get to know the game, your fellow players, and form your adventuring party.

The GM can also allow you at this time to makes some changes to your character’s advantages and hindrances based on your introduction. Ideally, this should represent the dramatic change in their life caused by their experience, but it can also help if you didn’t quite get your abilities right.

The aim of Dreamcatcher games is to work collaboratively with your other party members to ensure you complete goals, quests, missions and the like. This does not mean you have to always agree with each other, but you should work with the GM to ensure that the party is compatible enough to work together without stepping on each other’s toes.

### Step 9: Character Development

Character development is done thought a combination of two methods. The facing of your hindrances, and the expenditure of destiny points.

As explained in chapter 1, you can earn destiny points by accepting hindrances during a test, but further to this, every time you accept a hindrance and succeed in the test, you can place a check next to the hindrance.

Once a hindrance has been checked, you can spend two destiny points to turn this hindrance into an advantage. To do this, simply remove it from the hindrance section of your sheet, and change the “not good” section of the text to “good”.

_For example, Valar the Thief, played by Joe, was **“Not good at shadowing people”** but during an adventure he had accepted the hindrance while he made a Deft test to follow a wealthy merchant back to his house._

_Despite the hindrance he still succeeded, and placed a check mark next to this hindrance. After the end of the adventure, Joe spent 2 of his remaining destiny points to change this hindrance to an advantage. Now Valar has the advantage **“Good at shadowing people”**._

As well as gaining the new advantage, the player must then select TWO new hindrances to replace it. This way the number of hindrances should always match your advantages.

These new hindrances should be in keeping with your character’s premise or experiences during the adventure, and if possible should reflect tests he failed during the last story. Similarly, if he has suffered any temporary hindrances, these can be made permanent if it’s appropriate.
 
The GM is the final arbiter in what can and can’t be taken as these hindrances, but the decision should be made collaboratively and with some degree of flexibility.

_In our example, Joe has made Valar good at shadowing, but during the adventure he failed in his attempt to bluff his way past some guards. Also, Valar had a run in with the local thieves guild who are none too pleased about an unregistered thief running around. Therefore he adds **“Not good at bluffing”** and “Has a poor relationship with the Thieves Guild” to his hindrances._
