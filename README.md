# Shadow Catcher RPG System
The aim of this repository is to store the alpha and beta revisions of the ShadowCatcher RPG system. This is a generic and universal tablet top RPG system I have been developing slowly for a number of years.
## Aim
The aim of theis system is to create a narratively driven roleplaying game that is relatively rules light, but provides a suitable framework in place to aid games masters (and indeed players) who need a bit of rules to follow, without weiging down all those involved ina  complex rules system.
