## Chapter 1: Basic Rules
The core rule of the Dreamcatcher is that you first describe the actions of what you want your character to do. The GM will then determine if the action can simply take place, or if a test might be needed to determine success. A test use one of your character’s abilities and the dice to determine the final result of a proposed action.

As Dreamcatcher works on an approach based system, it is useful to think of your character's actions based on how they would approach the problem. For example, if your character is presented with a locked door, they may choose to use brute strength and Forcefully ram the door, they may be more subtle and Deftly trip the lock, or use their mental prowess and Intelligently find a flaw in the doors mechanism that allows it to be opened. Any of these approaches could feasibly overcome the obstacle, but the approach used by the character can determine the test used, and therefore change the chance of success. For more information on these, see the Ability Score section later.
### Tests
A test determines if your character’s raw talent and training are enough to overcome the obstacle presented to them. In many instances the GM will determine that a test is not needed, and that you will simply succeed. For example, if you are walking across a wide bridge in dry, calm conditions. However, if the GM determines that an action has a risk of failure with a significant consequence, he may call for a test. In contrast to the above example, a Deftness test would be called for if the bridge were a narrow rope bridge, swinging in the lashing wind and rain of a storm. Here the dice can determine the outcome of your action.
If a test is required, your GM will ask for a test using an ability of his choice. This should be the ability that best applies to the task.
### Performing a Test
To make a test you first need to refer to the ability on your character sheet.

_Roll the Dice_: To make a test, roll 2D6 (rolling two six sided dice together) and add the relevant ability score.
Announce the Total: Tell the GM the result of your test. Any roll of 10 or higher is a success, and any result lower than 10 is a failure.

_Using Advantages and Hindrances_: You have an Advantage you can call, or the GM may call a Hindrance to work against you. In these cases you will need to roll 3D6 and take the highest two numbers when calling an advantage, or the lowest two when suffering from a hindrance.

_Failure_: if you fail a test, you not only do not make any progress, but one of your ability scores becomes hampered, or one of your advantages is hampered if you used one (player choice).

_Combined Advantages and Hindrances_: If a situation arises whereby both a hindrance and an advantage are called or apply, they both cancel each other out (i.e. you roll 2D6 and add your ability normally). In this way, advantages can be used to cancel out a temporary hindrance or a hampered ability. However, if the GM calls a hindrance on your character sheet and you accept it for a destiny point you cannot then use an advantage to remove the hindrance penalty.

**NB** only one advantage and hindrance can apply at a time, therefore they cannot be stacked (i.e. you cannot use two advantages to cancel a hindrance and then gain an advantage).
#### Hampered Abilities and Advantages
If an ability has become hampered then you can still use it, but is treated as if it had a hindrance (i.e. roll 3D6 and keep the lowest two), even if you have an advantage you could call to aid in the situation.
Advantages that have become hampered cannot be called at all until they are recovered.
#### Degrees of Success
As already stated, roll a 10 or higher is a success, and anything below 10 is a failure. However, there are two more degrees of success or failure that can apply. If a player rolls a double 6 (i.e. both dice roll 6), then you have achieved a critical success and gain a temporary advantage. Conversely, if you roll a double 1, you suffer a critical failure and suffer a temporary hindrance as well as the normal hamper you accrue for failing as explained above. Therefore, the degrees of success for determine the outcome of a test is as follows, from best to worst:

* Critical Success
* Success
* Failure
* Critical Failure
#### Destiny Points
Characters start with a pool of 5 destiny points. These can be spent in one of two ways as follows:

* To reroll one die once per test
* To convert hindrances into advantages between stories (see later)

The use of destiny points for development will be discussed later, but the simplest use for them is to allow a player to reroll a single die once per test. The result of this reroll must be taken even if it is worse than the original roll.

There can be some danger in using destiny points in this way, but if the original roll was a failure or a critical failure, it may be worth the risk.

Destiny points are given out by GMs upon players completing a story, but they can also be earned by accepting called hindrances.

If a GM calls one of the characters hindrances to disadvantage an ability test, the player has one of two options. He can either accept the hindrance and earn a destiny point, or spend a destiny point and ignore the hindrance.

GMs cannot force you to face a hindrance, but neither can they be ignored lightly.
#### Resolving the Test
GMs and players are encouraged to resolve the test after just one roll. That is accepting that the attempt succeeded or failed. If any player wishes to try to achieve the same goal again, they must do so using another approach, as the one used previously failed.
More advice on framing tests and resolving them is covered in the Game Mastering section later.
### Contests
Contests are essentially tests that are opposed by another character instead of a predetermined or static obstacle. In these cases, success is determined by the relative fortunes of bother characters, supplemented by their abilities and advantages. The character with the highest degree of success then wins.

When to have a Contest: Generally, contests arise when either two characters attempt the same task, such as a race or both characters trying to snatch the same weapon from the rack, or if one character attempts an action that is actively opposed by another. An example of this might be trying to push over a barricade, where an enemy behind it pushes back to support it.

_Resolving a Contest_: the resolution is exactly the same as a normal test, in this case with both characters rolling, adding an ability and using any advantages or hindrances that apply. The character with the highest degree of success wins the contest, potentially either accomplishing a task, or preventing a task being completed as is appropriate.

Negative consequences for failures (i.e. any hindrances) apply as normal during a contest and can effect both participants.

In the case of a tie, then no progress is made one way or the other. In some situations this may benefit one character, as in above if they are holding up a barricade, but otherwise both characters remain in contest over the action for the next round, unless one chooses to concede by performing another action. If a tie would not makes sense in a contest, then a player character will win the contest over an NPC, or in the case of two player character’s contesting, then whichever is considered the aggressor will win. Where there are two PCs and no clear aggressor, then the result is a tie with a temporary advantage for both to be used later in the scene.

With respect to critical success and failures in ties, the following rules apply. If both participants gain a critical success in an opposed contest, then they both gain a temporary advantage to use during the scene, but with the result following the pattern above (i.e. PC over NPC, aggressor over defender etc.).

If both participants roll critical failures in an opposed contest, then they both gain a temporary hindrance that can be called in the scene, but the player character will still win the contest over an NPC, or in the case of two player character’s contesting, then whichever is considered the defender will win. Where there are two PCs and no clear defender, then the result is a tie with a temporary hindrance for both that could be called later in the scene.
#### Resolving the Contest
Similar to resolving a simple test, a contest should ideally end once there is a clear winner and/or loser. Rematches are always possible, but players and GMs should be wary of repeating contests to get some desired end.

More advice on framing contests and resolving them is covered in the Game Mastering section later.

However, one contest that is likely to continue beyond just the one roll is combat.
### Combat
If the goal of a test is to overpower an opponent or otherwise defeat them, then this should be resolved as a contest in the way outlined above but with the additional rule below.

Any hindrances suffered due to a test failure are suffered as normal. In addition, the winner of a combat contest, can chose to impose another hindrance on their opponent. The opponent’s player choses if this hindrance applies to an ability or an advantage that could apply to the combat. 

Note that an advantage hampered in this way does not have to have been called by the opponent during the current round of the contest, but should be applicable to the action of the scene.

The GM is the final arbiter on which advantages can be used to soak damage in this way, but common sense should prevail. For example, if two soldiers were fighting on a battlement and one lost a combat test, he could chose to have his “Good with a shield” advantage to be hampered even though he used his “Good with a sword” advantage during the fight.

What he could not do, is chose his “Good at swimming” advantage to be hampered unless he gives a good reason for why this should be so (e.g. if he explains that he has taken a leg injury which means he now cannot swim very well). GMs are encouraged to reward creativity, but only within the scope of the setting.

After each test, each participant can chose to continue the test or concede and allow the other to win. If no one concedes, then the contest continues until one participant has been taken out of the scene (see later).
### Multiple participants and Aiding
If there are multiple participants in a test, usually more than one PC trying to achieve the same aim, then one character should be identified as the lead character, and the characters will roll to augment the leads roll.

To aid another in a test, the augmenting characters must describe what they are doing, and how this will aid the leads action. Ideally, this should use an different approach or advantage to that being used by the lead character, but GMs are encourage to use their discretion as to whether the proposed action is in keeping with the game.

In a test, the aiding characters roll as in a normal test (aiming for a 10 or better), and take any negative consequences for a failed roll to aid. If they succeed the lead character’s final degree of success is increased by one level per successful aid (e.g. critical fail becomes a fail, a fail becomes a success etc.). 

The final degree of success cannot go above a critical success using this method.

A critical failure not only hampers the aiding character, but creates a hindrance for the lead character. Sometimes a well-meaning helper can make things worse.

If an aiding character rolls a critical success, they not only aid the lead character but can give them a temporary advantage they can chose to use instead of their normal advantage. Alternatively, the critical success can be used to negate a hindrance from a critical failure to aid (essentially, critical successes and failures cancel each other out during aid attempts).

Aiding in a contest works in the same way but with one significant difference. In a normal test, the lead character’s success cannot go higher than a critical success and any aids that would push it up beyond this are essentially wasted.

In a contest (including ones involving combat) each increase above a critical success can be used to reduce your opponent’s success level down by one. 

Again, using this method and opponent can only have their success reduced down as far as a critical failure, but surely that’s bad enough.

For more advice on handing multiple participants in contests, see the Game Mastering section later.
### Narrative Override
Most game systems suggest that as the GM, you have the final say on any ambiguities or rules disputes. The spirit of Dreamcatcher is that you should take this much further. As the GM, you shouldn’t let the rules get in the way of your players having a good time. As such, we introduce here the concept of Narrative Override. As the name might suggest to you, this means that you can override the rules of the game, if it is in the interest of making the story a good one.
