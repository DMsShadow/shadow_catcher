## Vehicles as Characters
Essentially Dreamcatcher treats vehicles as larger versions of characters, in the sense that a vehicle record sheet is an extrapolation of a player character sheet. Each vehicle has attributes (derived from the pilot or crew of the vehicle depending on its size and scale, see later), as well as advantages, hindrances and equipment slots.
This is deliberate in order to keep the mechanics of Dreamcatcher as consistent and simple as possible. Since the mechanics of vehicles follows that of characters, so do all the subsequent tests and results of conflicts.
### Scale
When dealing with vehicles and ships, there is a new attribute that is not covered by the standard rules and that is scale. Normal Pcs are considered scale 1, personal vehicles such as cars, vans, jets etc. are scale 2, and larger vehicles such as warships and starships are considered scale 3. The main impact of scale is in dealing and absorbing hindrances during a test against an opponent of a differing scale.
To a target of a higher scale, it takes three times as many losses to produce a hindrance for each level of difference (e.g. 3 for scale 1 to 2, and 9 for scale 1 to 3).  If an opponent of a higher scale is actively attacking a target of a lower scale it takes 3 times as many hindrances per loss for every level of difference in scale.
### Size
Determines how many advantages and equipment slots each vehicle has in its scale band.
### Abilities
The abilities of a vehicle are derived from those of the pilot or crew of that vehicle. If the vehicle has only the one crew slot (i.e. just a pilot or driver), then all the vehicles abilities are based on this driver. If the vehicle has multiple crew slots, then the abilities of the characters manning those stations determines the abilities of the vehicle. Usually, the larger the vehicle, the more numerous the crew slots and therefore the better able they are to have competent abilities in multiple areas.
### Advantages, hindrances and equipment slots
Not derived from the crew, but unique to each vehicle. Table shows how many for each size level within a scale.
Based around systems and therefore not as freeform as normal, vehicle either has good or poor, if doesnâ€™t say then its average. These need to be determined e.g. manoeuvring, propulsion, targeting, defence, scanning, etc.
### Crew positions
Vehicles of a scale higher than 1 can have multiple crew positions.
