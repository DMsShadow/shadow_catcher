## Chapter 2: Ability Scores

All characters have five abilities: Forceful, Deft, Resilient, Intelligent and Perceptive. These represent the various approaches that your character can take in resolving obstacles or completing actions within Dreamcatcher. A character also has a score attached to each ability. Your ability score broadly defines your natural talent and skill in each of the five approaches. The higher your score, the better your character is with that approach. Typically, all non-player characters and creatures also have values in the five ability scores.

A score of 2 is considered average for a human adult, with a 5 being the highest achievable for a normal person. Adventurers may have scores as high as 6 and monsters and other powerful beings may be even higher still.

Each ability listed is followed by an example of what kind of test that a player would be expected to use that ability for, and an example of the kind of hindrances they may suffer if they fail a test.

### Forceful

This measures your ability to exert physical force using your raw muscle power. Forcefulness is used to perform feats when climbing, swimming, jumping, fighting, and any other situation that would rely on brute force.

_Tests_  
A Forcefulness test may be called for whenever a feat of force is required to overcome a challenge. Examples include opening a jammed door, pushing over an opponent, arm wrestling another person and so on. Similarly, a Forcefulness test may be needed to resist an effect, such as a severe gust of wind, to hold on to a cliff face for a prolonged period of time, or any other effect the GM feels would require Forcefulness to resist.

### Deft

This is a measure of how, nimble, agile and quick your character is. Deft is used to perform feats where speed, dexterity and balance are needed as well as to avoid blows in combat.

_Tests_  
A Deftness test may be required whenever your speed, agility or nimbleness is the major factor in overcoming a challenge. Examples include determining turn order in combat, tumbling past enemies, and walking across a narrow ledge to name but a few. A Deftness test may also be used to avoid some kind of danger, such as diving for cover from an explosion or dragon's breath, and avoiding traps, as well as resisting effects than may keep you off balance, e.g. Staying upright on a deck of a ship during a storm.

### Resilient

Resilience is a measure of the physical endurance of a character. It is used to not only determine how tough your character is by adding to hit points, but it can also be used to resist physical effects such as poisoning and disease. Being highly Resilient does not necessarily mean the character is large or robust looking, but it may certainly suggest they could be.

_Tests_  
A Resilience test may be required any time a character's endurance or physical resistance would be indicated in a test. Examples include running or swimming for a prolonged period of time, or holding your breath under water. As suggested above, a test may also be called for to resist a poison or disease, as well as any supernatural effects that attack the body or health of a character.

### Intelligent

The Intelligence ability measures a characters intellect, memory, learning, recall, quick wits and anything else the GM determines that the Human brain has dominance over. Intelligence is used where brain power or memory would be the deciding factor in a test.
 
_Tests_  
The GM may call for an Intelligence test to determine if you know an obscure fact, or recall a piece of important information, and may even allow a test to give clues to solving riddles. The Intelligence ability can also be used to resist effects such as mental domination, trickery, or some spells.

### Perceptive
Perceptiveness measures how observant and aware of their surroundings a character is. It is used whenever a character may be able to notice something, or pick up on minor details that may be useful to them. This ability covers the physical senses such as sight, hearing, taste and touch.

_Tests_  
A Perceptiveness test may be called for to spot a hidden trap, hear voices behind a door, or notice bandits waiting in ambush behind dense foliage. Perceptiveness is unlikely to be used to resist any effect, but is more likely to be an opposed roll against an opponentâ€™s attempt to hide or deceive you.
