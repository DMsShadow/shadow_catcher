## Chapter 2: Ability Scores
All characters have five abilities: Forceful, Deft, Resilient, Intelligent and Perceptive. These represent the various approaches that your character can take in resolving tests and challenges in ShadowCatcher. A character also has a die type (d4, d6, d8, d10 or d12) attached to each ability. Your ability die broadly defines your natural talent and skill in each of the five approaches. The higher your die type, the better your character is with that approach. Typically, all non-player characters and creatures do not have die types assigned to approaches as they do not roll any dice.

The d8 is considered average for a human adult, with a d12 being the highest achievable for a normal person. Adventurers don't have any scores above the d12, but instead rely on traits to add to a test roll.

Each ability is listed below followed by an example of what kind of test that a player would be expected to use that ability for, and an example of the kind of hindrances they may suffer if they fail a test.
### Forceful
This measures your ability to exert physical force using your raw muscle power. Forcefulness is used to overcome challenges when climbing, swimming, jumping, fighting, and any other situation that would rely on brute force.
#### Tests
A Forcefulness test may be called for whenever a feat of force is required to overcome a challenge. Examples include opening a jammed door, pushing over an opponent, arm wrestling another person and so on. Similarly, a Forcefulness test may be needed to resist the effects of a dynamic challenge, such as a severe gust of wind, to hold on to a cliff face for a prolonged period of time, or any other effect the GM feels would require Forcefulness to resist.
### Deft
This is a measure of how, nimble, agile and quick your character is. Deft is used to overcome challenges where speed, dexterity and balance are needed.
#### Tests
A Deftness test may be required whenever your speed, agility or nimbleness is the major factor in overcoming a challenge. Examples include, tumbling past enemies, and walking across a narrow ledge to name but a few. A Deftness test may also be used to avoid the effects of a dynamic challenge such as diving for cover from an explosion or dragon's breath, and avoiding traps, as well as resisting dynamic challenges that may keep you off balance, e.g. Staying upright on a deck of a ship during a storm.
### Resilient
Resilience is a measure of the physical endurance of a character. It is used to resist dynamic challenges that cause physical effects such as poisoning and disease, and other situations where pure phyisical resilience could block, or stave off an effect. Being highly Resilient does not necessarily mean the character is large or robust looking, but it may certainly suggest they could be.
#### Tests
A Resilience test may be required any time a character's endurance or physical resistance would be indicated in a challenge. Examples include running or swimming for a prolonged period of time, or holding your breath under water. As suggested above, a test may also be called for to resist a dynamic challenge relating to poison or disease, as well as any supernatural effects that attack the body or health of a character.
### Intelligent
The Intelligence ability measures a characters intellect, memory, learning, recall, quick wits and anything else the GM determines that the Human brain has dominance over. Intelligence is used where brain power or memory would be the deciding factor in a test.
#### Tests
The GM may call for an Intelligence test to determine if you know an obscure fact, or recall a piece of important information, and may even allow a tests to overcome challenges involving solving riddles. The Intelligence ability can also be used to resist effects of dynamic challenges that include effects like mental domination, trickery, or some spells.
### Perceptive
Perceptiveness measures how observant and aware of their surroundings a character is. It is used whenever a character may be able to notice something, or pick up on minor details that may be useful to them. This ability covers the physical senses such as sight, hearing, taste and touch.
#### Tests
A Perceptiveness test may be called for to overcome a challenge involving a hidden trap, hear voices behind a door, or notice bandits waiting in ambush behind dense foliage. Perceptiveness can be used in some instances to resist a dynamic challenge effect if an opponent is, for example, attempting to hide or deceive you.
