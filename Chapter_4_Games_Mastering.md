## Chapter 4: Games Mastering
This section of the rules is intended to be a helpful resource for GMs when running ShadowCatcher games.
### Time
Time in ShadowCatcher is treated more fluidly than many tactical roleplaying games. Instead of rigid turn or rounds, player’s actions take place in scenes that make up part of a chapter or larger story.
Players have the majority of control over scenes, but the GM should direct them and facilitate the end of scenes to move on to the next scene or the conclusion of the chapter or story.
#### Scene
A scene is the shortest measurement of time in ShadowCatcher, but can be anything from a few seconds to several days depending on the situation. A scene is like a scene or chapter of a book. It usually takes place in the same location or area and involves a short interaction with the surroundings or people.
A scene may or may not involve a test or contest, but at the very least the players will have to describe what their characters are doing and what they try to achieve in a scene.
Traditionally, a scene ends when the characters or the GM feels it’s time to move on to a new one. It is likely to be quite clear in practice as to when a scene begins or ends.
An example of a scene may be the characters going to the King’s audience chamber to petition him for aid in the war against the northern barbarians, or a dramatic car chase through the streets of Paris.
#### Act
An act is an optional measure of time. It is simply a collection of scenes that make up a subsection of a story. They can be useful to divide a story into manageable sections, but they are by no means mandatory.
For example, the first act of a story might be scenes in which the characters gather clues on serious of mysterious crimes and rituals that are taking place around the city. The second act could be a series or run ins with the evil cultists who are trying to hamper their investigations. The final act could then be the scenes where the characters sneak in to the evil temple and finally face the cult leader.
#### Story
A story is a collection of scenes that ultimately lead to some final or larger resolution. For example, the characters could be investigating mysterious murders in a town, and the story is resolved when either the murder is caught, or he escapes the player’s clutches. In the example of acts above, all three acts would make the story.
#### Session
A session does not relate to game time, but is the real life time period in which players get together with the GM to play through scenes or even whole stories. Some actions may only occur between sessions.
### Distance and Movement
Distance in ShadowCatcher is as abstract or as accurate as you want it to be. It is less important during scenes as to exactly how far people can move or shoot, as it is that players are able to describe what they are trying to do. If the GM feels that the goal is not achievable based on the physics of the world then then simply need to say so, if it is simply difficult they can chose to apply a hindrance to the roll if they feel it is appropriate.
Larger distances should be handled in whatever way works best with the group. If you want to use accurate maps and realistic measures of movement then feel free, but if you agree to wing it and guestimate travel times then just do that.
As with most rules in ShadowCatcher, the GM is the final arbiter in what is or isn’t allowed.
### Perception
The world is subject to many things that can affect how well your characters perceive it. Darkness, mist or smoke to name but a few. GMs can use these just from atmospheric effect, or they can be used to create a hindrance for your characters. In some settings, you may be able to obtain equipment or have species traits that can overcome these hindrances.
All such advantages are to be used at the GMs discretion.
### Hampering, Injury and Death
Any time a character fails a test or is bested in combat, they must hamper either an advantage or an ability. In ShadowCatcher, such hampering constitutes the reduced ability of the character to continue in the story. A character can continue with the story so long as they have at least one ability which isn’t hampered, but if they have all of their abilities hampered, the character is taken out of the scene, or even longer.
#### Hampered Abilities
Hampered abilities usually, but not always, represent some kind of physical or psychological trauma. Essentially, the character has becomes injured in such a way that they cannot use the ability as well as before.
As stated previously, hampered abilities can still be used to complete tests, but they do so as if they were being called with a hindrance (i.e. roll 3D6 and use the lowest two dice).
#### Hampered Advantages
If an advantage becomes hampered, usually due to being called during a test which failed and used to ‘soak’ the failure, then it cannot be used again until it is recovered (see later).
This hampering can be anything that makes sense as part of the narrative and can include physical injury, social exclusion, fatigue, illness etc. It is optional for characters and GMs as to if they record what the hampering actually is.
#### Hampered Relationships
If a relationship becomes hampered as part of test or contest then it is not useable until it is recovered and could mean either damage to the relationship, injury of the individual/group or a restriction on those persons to aid the character.
Examples can include a friend being injured protecting you, a snitch being kidnapped by a criminal organisation, or a patron being displeased with the demands you have made on them.
Such hampering should reflect the likely effect on the other party if the test should fail. Recover will involve the situation changing either by time or direct player action.
#### Hampered Possessions
If a possession is hampered, it has been rendered useless in some way, either it has become damaged, lost, powered down or otherwise removed from the immediate action.
Again, it cannot be used again until it has been recovered in some way.
#### Being Taken Out
If a character has no choice but to hamper the last of their abilities as part of a test or contest, then they are taken out. A character that is taken out is removed from the scene in a way chosen by the GM and cannot return to the story until they are able to recover at least one of their abilities.
Being removed from the game in this way should not normally result in character death (see below), but is not ideal for the player as they have no say in what actually happens to their character.
#### Conceding
If during a contest, usually combat, a player is concerned their character will be taken out, they can instead chose to concede the contest. This results in them losing the contest and being taken out. 
However, the character takes no further negative effects (i.e. no other abilities can be hampered), and the player decides how the character is removed from the current scene. They are then free to return to the next scene as they will have unhampered abilities remaining.
Advantage Death and Destruction
Any permanent loss of a person or item cannot be done without the consent of the player and should only occur from a critical failure during a dramatic scene. As removing such advantages can reduce the strength of a character, the GM should work with the player to create a replacement very rapidly (i.e. during the same or subsequent story).
#### Character Death
As stated above, being taken out shouldn’t routinely result in the death of a character. However, a player may choose to have a character die if they are taken out during a test or contest. This choice must always be the players, and they then choose exactly how the character dies (overriding the rule above).
The death does not have to be literal (although it’s more dramatic if it is), as they character could suffer a metaphorical death. This may be more appropriate, especially in situations where they have lost a social or intellectual conflict.
The upside to character death is that the player can create a new character with all their advantages and abilities unhampered. Albeit at the loss of their beloved character.
The new character can be at the same competence level as the old one (i.e. the same number of advantages), or have only the starting advantages at the GMs discretion, but this must be explained to the player before they agree to the death.
### Healing and Recovery
There are two ways in which characters can recover from their abilities and advantages being hampered.
#### Recovery between stories
At the end of each story, each player can chose one ability or advantage to automatically unhamper. For all other abilities and advantages that are hampered, the player rolls 2D6 and on an 8 or higher it recovers and becomes unhampered.
This recovery represents rest, recuperation, medical treatment, psychological treatment, social interaction and any other activity that can fix the damage done. This recover takes time and so does not occur during a story.
#### Recovery during a story
At the GMs discretion, a player with a relevant advantage (e.g. medical skill, psychoanalysis, magic etc.) can make a check to help recover one advantage or ability per player either during or immediately after a scene.
To do this, the healing player must make a test with the relevant advantage. On a success they recover the ability or advantage, and on a critical success they can recover two. A failure results in the loss of the healing advantage as normal, and a critical failure results in the loss of this advantage and further hampering of the character (e.g. another ability or advantage becomes hampered as well).
Please note, that no matter which advantages are used, only one test can be made per character per scene.
### Managing Scenes
This section gives advice on how to open, manage and close scenes. When a scene closes it should ideal flow into the next scene as naturally as possible.
#### The first scene
There is no hard and fast rule about who should open a scene, but often the first scene will be proposed by the GM in order to start the story. If, however, a player proposes a scene to start the story, the GM should consider it if it’s in keeping with the story so far
Taking tips from story writing, the best way to open a story is in media res, that is, in the middle of some action. The characters and thus the players should be thrown straight into some kind of action. Whether it be an unexpected combat, a summons in front of the King or some other similarly dramatic situation is not important, just so long as it’s engaging for the players.
I would suggest not opening with characters getting out of bed, going shopping, or some other mundane task, unless you plan to throw some unexpected action at them pretty quick. Get the action going as soon as you can.
#### Managing the flow of the scene
In most cases the flow of the scene should take care of itself. The players should lead on proposing what their characters do, and GM translates this into descriptions of what happens, tests, or contests as needed.
Occasionally a scene may start to stall. That is, the players may start to struggle with ideas of what to do next, or where they should go. In all likelihood, this is a signal that the scene is coming to an end, and the GM ought to move towards closing the scene (see below).
If there is merit in the scene continuing, then you as the GM can consider giving some hints to nudge the players in the right direction. Beware overusing this tactic however, as you can end up directing all the action and start railroading your players to where you want them to go rather than by what they want to do. 
Subtlety is better here, and maybe just have NPCs hint at information they may have, rather than suggested things out of character. Remember, NPCs have motives too. Use them to your advantage here.
#### Closing the scene
Eventually any scene will have to end. It’s more than likely that your players will start to do this for you, suggesting that they go somewhere else, or move on to questioning another character.
Ideally you should aim for this transition to be led by players as much as possible but, as stated above, sometimes the scene can begin to slow as players lose a sense of what they are doing.
If you feel they have gained all they need from the scene, prompt them to consider where they can go next. Here again, subtlety is best. Rather than stating you can go here, here or here, perhaps ask them to summarise what they have learned, and where they think they need to go next.
In the end, if all else fails, then a GM you always have the option to either suggest a next scene, or throw in some action to move things along.
The action method can sometimes be the best. Depending on your setting, a sudden attack or other dramatic occurrence (perhaps a theft or an arrest) can get things moving along nicely. Never be afraid to shake things up a bit if the plot begins to stall.
#### Proposing the next scene
Leading on from the above, at least one of the players should propose the next scene. In these cases they should describe where they are going or what they are doing to start the new scene. As GM you would then take the prompt to describe how this scene begins, and let the players begin the interaction all over again.
If you have introduced some action to start a new scene, you will have proposed the new scene yourself, but again allow the players to lead the action once it has commenced.
### Managing Test
A test will occurring during a scene, if and when at least one player proposes an action that you as the GM feel has a risk of going wrong in a dramatically appropriate way.
#### Is a test required?
This is an important question that should always be asked, and equally applies to contests. Really think about what making the player roll for the result will add to the scene and their enjoyment of the game.
Many a game has been spoiled by characters having to roll to go up and down a ladder in a well light house in perfect conditions. Other than a comedy factor if it goes wrong (which may be appropriate depending on the kind of game you are playing), what does that add?
Now, climbing up a ladder made slippery but torrential rain, as you attempt to flee a band of thugs bent on your destruction… that makes for some drama. Here, a test would be perfect.
As the GM it is your job to keep the game flowing, so remember that tests and contests can break up the flow of a story if used too often, but can really add to the tension when used at the right time.
If a test feels appropriate, then next step is to determine what is occurring, and what the player wants to achieve. In other words, they need to frame the test.
Framing the test

#### Resolving the test

#### Useful failures

### Managing Contests
Contests should be called in a similar fashion to tests (i.e. only when dramatically appropriate), but where the outcome is based on an important interaction between more than one character.
### NPCs
#### Mooks
Mooks are disposable NPCs. These are the kind of uncredited characters you see in movies that are taken out by the heroes in a strike or two. When assigning statistics to Mooks, they are assumed to have a score of 1 in every ability, and no advantages to call.
Regardless of their abilities, Mooks only ever have one hindrance box. Once this has been used, the Mook is taken out of the scene.
Due to the nature of Mooks, the GM can choose to either handle them individually, or use them collectively as a mob. If they are collated as a mob, then their hindrances boxes are combined.
Mundane animals such as rats, dogs and possibly wolves can be treated as Mooks for the purposes of combat.
#### Named Characters
These have two advantages and two hindrance boxes. Essentially they are foundation characters but with reduced statistics.
Ability scores: 1, 1, 2, 3 and a 3
#### Significant Characters
These characters are approaching the level of the PCs, they will often three or four advantages but should always be less influential than the PCs. This may be either due to their statistics, advantages or both.
Ability scores: 1, 2, 2, 3 and a 4
#### Major Characters
As the name suggests, these characters occupy a major role in the story that is being told. Major NPC characters should be created and advanced in the same way as normal PCs. They should have player level statistics (i.e. a 1, 2, 3, 4, and a 5 in their abilities) and advantages that are comparable to, or perhaps even slightly exceed those of the main party.
Major characters can be either a significant mentor, superior or other ally to the party, or they could be the main villain or villains that the party are trying to overcome.
#### Monster
